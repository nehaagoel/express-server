# MERN STACK:
MERN stack is the name given to a set of JavaScript based technologies used in developing web applications. MERN is the acronym name given to the set of technologies including Mongo DB, Express JS, React JS/ Redux and Node JS. Among these technologies Mongo DB is a database system, Node JS is a back-end runtime environment, Express JS is a back-end web framework and React is a front-end framework.These components provide an end-to-end framework for developers to work in.  

**Mongo DB:A cross-platform document database**
Mongo DB is a free and open-source cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a No SQL database program, Mongo DB uses JSON-like documents with schemata. Mongo DB is developed by Mongo DB Inc., and is published under a combination of the GNU Affero General Public License and the Apache License.

**Express: A back-end web application framework**
Express.js, or simply Express, is a web application framework for Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building robust web applications and APIs. It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.

**React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces**
React (also known as React.js or React JS) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. With React, the same code can run on both the server and the browser.

**Node.js: A cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment**
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write Command Line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.

# Benefits of MERN Stack
* The main advantage for developers using the MERN stack is that every line of code is written in JavaScript. 
* JS is a programming language that’s used everywhere, both for client-side code and server-side code. 
* With one language across tiers, there’s no need for context switching.
* With the JavaScript stack, developers only need to be proficient in JavaScript and JSON. 
* Using the MERN stack enables developers to build highly efficient web applications.
